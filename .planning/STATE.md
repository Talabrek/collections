## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

Major decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Full decision history archived in `.planning/milestones/`.

### Known Issues

- Pre-existing MockBukkit test failure (IncompatibleClassChangeError) - does not affect functionality, only test suite. Requires MockBukkit update for Paper 1.21.4.
- Pre-existing flaky test (testAddItemOffline_UsesCache) - race condition in test, not implementation
- ParticleTask missing EPIC/LEGENDARY switch cases (cosmetic only - visibility works, particles don't display for these tiers)

### Pending Todos

- Define v1.3 requirements
- Create v1.3 roadmap
